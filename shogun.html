            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>Shogun Frontend, a platform designed to simplify website development for e-commerce, faced low adoption
                due to a clunky user experience. My research aimed to uncover the pain points of developers and
                administrators to inform a platform redesign, ultimately increasing user satisfaction and platform
                adoption.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>My Role & Responsibilities</h4>
              <p>As the UX Researcher, I led a mixed-methods research initiative to understand the needs of Shogun's
                core user groups. My responsibilities included: planning and executing usability testing, conducting
                in-depth interviews, synthesizing research findings, and collaborating with Design and Product teams to
                translate insights into actionable design recommendations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>Shogun Frontend was intended to provide developer-friendly interfaces for building e-commerce websites.
                However, the initial design was created with limited input from developers and administrators, resulting
                in a platform that didn't meet their needs. This led to low adoption rates and negative feedback,
                hindering Shogun's growth potential. Developers struggled with the platform's workflow, while
                administrators felt limited in their ability to manage website content independently.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Research Process</h4>
              <p>To understand the user experience, I employed a mixed-methods approach:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Usability Testing: I conducted usability testing with 10 developers, observing their interactions with
                  the platform's core functionalities. Participants were asked to perform tasks such as creating a new
                  webpage, customizing a template, and integrating a plugin. The testing revealed that the text-heavy
                  interface and complex navigation made it difficult for developers to quickly find and use the tools
                  they needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In-depth Interviews: I conducted in-depth interviews with 8 administrators to understand their
                  workflows and pain points. The interviews revealed a significant frustration with their dependence on
                  developers for even minor website updates. They expressed a desire for a more visual and intuitive
                  interface that would empower them to manage content independently.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mixed-Methods Approach: This approach allowed me to gather both quantitative data on usability issues
                  (from the testing) and qualitative insights into the users' motivations and frustrations (from the
                  interviews). This combination provided a holistic understanding of the user experience.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Key Insights</h4>
              <p>The research revealed two key user needs:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Developers: They desired a platform that provided a toolbox of pre-built components and templates,
                  rather than requiring them to build websites from scratch after migrating their online storefronts to
                  the Shogun platform. They wanted to focus on customization and integration, not rebuilding.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Administrators: They needed a more visual and intuitive interface that would empower them to manage
                  and update website content without relying on developers. They needed a "what you see is what you get"
                  experience.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="image-section">

            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>Based on these findings, the platform's interface was redesigned to prioritize visual tools and
                pre-built components. Key changes included:
                A drag-and-drop interface was implemented for administrators, allowing them to visually manage and
                update website content.
                A library of customizable templates and pre-built components was created for developers, enabling them
                to quickly build and customize websites.
                The navigation was simplified and made more intuitive, based on user feedback from the usability
                testing.

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Results and Impact</h4>
              <p>Post-launch, the redesigned platform achieved a 3-point increase in customer satisfaction, as measured
                by the average Net Promoter Score (NPS). This improvement reflects the positive impact of the
                user-centered redesign on both developer and administrator satisfaction. The platform also received
                positive qualitative feedback, with users praising its ease of use and increased efficiency.</p>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
              <p>This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design and the value of mixed-methods research.
                I learned that understanding the specific needs of different user groups is crucial for creating
                successful products. In future projects, I would explore incorporating user feedback earlier in the
                design process to ensure that user needs are addressed from the outset.</p>
