              <p>Tailored for ecommerce usecases, Shogun Frontend provided developer friendly interfaces to make it easier for programmers to build websites from end-to-end. However, its inital design was crafted with limited  input from developers, and other core customers, which resulted in a clunky and confusing user experience. In collaboration with Shogun's Design and Product teams, I led research to investigate the challenges, assumed and to be discovered, users encountered while building websites. Using a mixed methods approach, which included, usability testing and in-depth interviews, I evaluated the product's UI Design and Interaction Design, and generated deep customer insights.

              <p>Shogun developers had to migrate sites by rebuilding them from the ground up. It was a lot of work and they wanted to stop building custom frameworks and spend their time customizing templates and scripting plugins. They wanted templates and plugins. They wanted the platform to be a toolbox not a blank canvas. They were tired of blank pages.

            <div class="regular-content-section">
              <p>Shogun Administrators had to maintain the new sites by uploading and archiving content. When a design element need to change they worked with developers for support. They wanted to manage pages visually and have seamless developer support. The wanted the platform to make them feel like (novice) developers. They were tired of feeling helpless. They were also tired of repeating the same 'uploading' tasks hundreds of times a day.

            <div class="regular-content-section">
              <p>With these insights and the results of the usability tests, the platform was transformed from text heavy, minimalistic interfaces into a beautiful, and more importantly, usable website builder.
