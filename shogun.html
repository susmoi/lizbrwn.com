              <h3>Empowering Developers and Administrators Through UX Research</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>Shogun Frontend was a Progressive Web Application (PWA) development platform that intended to simplify website development. However, due to a less than ideal user experience it developers were slow to migrate to the new platform, and content administrators less than eager to learn a new management system. Shogun Frontend was a complex platform and its users had complex nuanced reasons for why their experience was less than ideal. In a nutshell this product had a ton of moving, interconnected parts. But that's what makes taking a human-centered approach to research clarifying, it focuses on understanding the product from the subjective perspective of the developers and administrators using it, revealing common themes and patterns, that the Shogun product team used to update the platform, increase user satisfaction, and scale the product to more users.  
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Role & Responsibilities</h4>
              <p>As the UX Researcher, I led a mixed-methods research initiative to understand the needs of Shogun's
                core user groups. My responsibilities included: planning and executing usability testing, conducting
                in-depth interviews, synthesizing research findings, and collaborating with Design and Product teams to
                translate insights into actionable design recommendations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>Shogun Frontend was intended to provide an all-in-one platform for building and maintaining
                lighting-fast ecommerce websites using Progressive Web Application (PWA) technology.
                However, the initial platform was created with limited input from developers and administrators,
                resulting
                in a platform that didn't meet their needs. This led to low adoption rates and negative feedback,
                hindering Shogun's growth potential. Developers struggled with the platform's workflow, while
                administrators felt limited in their ability to manage website content independently.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>The Research Process</h4>
              <p>To understand the user experience, I employed a mixed-methods approach to gather both quantitative data and qualitative insights:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Usability Testing: I conducted usability testing with 10 developers and 10 administrators. They were asked to complete tasks related to the platform's core user flows (building individual web elements, creating an entire webpage, managing a site's content management system).
                </li>
                <li>
                  In-depth Interviews: In-depth Interviews: I moderated semi-structured discussions with 5 developers and 5 administrators to better
                  understand the pain points and desires
                  revealed during testing.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Key Insights</h4>
              <p>The research revealed two key user needs:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Developers: Testing and interviews highlighted the need for the platform to provide more
                  value out-of-the-box. Developers wanted to leverage pre-built components and templates to quickly create
                  functional sites, freeing their time for more specialized development tasks and higher-value
                  contributions. They wanted to focus on customization and integration, not rebuilding.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Administrators: Testing and interviews revealed the need for a more visual and intuitive interface. Administrators wanted independence from needed to ask developers any time they wanted to make even a minor update to their websites. They wanted to be empowered to manage
                  and update content without relying on developers. They needed a "what you see is what you get"
                  experience.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="image-section">
              <figure>
                <img class="project-image" src="images/shogun-frontend-developer-JTBD.jpg" alt="" />
                <figcaption>
                  <p>Mapping Developer JTBDs vs Product offerings</p>
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>Based on these findings, the platform's interface was updated to prioritize visual tools and
                pre-built components. Key changes included:
                A more visual interface for administrators, allowing them to more clearly see the website content they
                were managing and updating.
                A library of customizable templates and pre-built components for developers, enabling them
                to quickly build and customize websites.
                And the navigation was redesigned to be more intuitive and user-friendly, simplifying wayfinding.

            <div class="image-section">
              <figure>
                <img class="project-image" src="images/shogun-frontend-4.gif" alt="" />
                <figcaption>
                  <p>Enhanced visuals and easy-to-use website building blocks</p>

              </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Results and Impact</h4>
              <p>Post-launch of the updates, I monitored the user behavior using Fullstory (a data analytics tool) to observe if it was easier for developers and administrators to preform core tasks like the ones tested and discussed. While it seemed as if it was, based on time on tasks, decrease in user errors, and UX goals, I was able to concretely confirm the increase in user satisfaction by comparing the average Net Promoter Score (NPS) pre and post launch--it jumped 3-points after we introduced our human-centered product updates!.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
              <p>This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design and the value of mixed-methods research.
                Understanding the specific needs of different user groups is crucial for creating
                successful products. In future projects, I would explore incorporating user feedback earlier in the
                design process to ensure that user needs are addressed from the outset.</p>
