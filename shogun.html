              <h3>Empowering Developers and Administrators to Create Lightning Fast Websites.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>Shogun Frontend was a Progressive Web Application (PWA) development platform. With PWAs, even a content-heavy ecommence site loads instantly. And in the world of online storefronts, quick load times are
                directly correlated to higher conversion rates. However, developing PWAs is a huge lift, requiring developers to wrangle a large stack of tech tools and orchestrate them to work together in perfect harmony. Shogun Frontend was built to simplify these development processes by combining numerous technologies into one product. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>Shogun Frontend was initially built with limited input from developers and administrators.
                So while the beta platform provided an all-in-one solution, it also provided a less-than-ideal user experience. As a result, developers were hesitant to sign on and migrate their websites to Shogun Frontend. Additionally, content administrators were less than eager to learn a new management system. The Shogun product team needed to understand why users hesitated to adopt the platform and how they could design it to be user-friendly before Shogun officially launched the PWA product.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Discovery Research Methods</h4>
              <p>To understand the Shogun Frontend's initial user experience, I used a mixed-methods approach to
                gather quantitative data
                and qualitative insights:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Usability Testing: to understand the beta user experience, I conducted 30-minute usability tests with 10 developers and 10 administrators. During which participants were
                  asked to complete tasks related to Shogun Frontend's core user flows (building individual web
                  elements, creating an entire webpage, managing a site's content management system).
                </li>
                <li>
                  In-depth Interviews: to better understand the pain points and desires revealed during testing and explore their user mindsets and Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBDs), I moderated 60-minute semi-structured discussions with 5 developers and 5 administrators. 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Key Insights</h4>
              <p>The research revealed two key user needs:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Developers spent a lot of time building numerous website elements from scratch (product image grids, buttons, navigation bars, etc) and their time and skills could be better spent on specialized development tasks, like creating custom landing pages or integrating third-party APIs.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Administrators were dependent on developers for even the most minor content updates. But were intimidated by Shogun Frontend's technical interface, they wanted to make changes to their website without needing a high degree of technical knowledge.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="image-section">
              <figure>
                <img class="project-image" src="images/shogun-frontend-developer-JTBD.jpg" alt="" />

              </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>A library of customizable templates and pre-built components for developers, enabling them
                to put webpages together quickly.
                An enhanced visual user interface for administrators that allowed them to see the website content they manage and update more clearly.
                The navigation was redesigned to be more intuitive and user-friendly, simplifying wayfinding.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-section">
              <figure>
                <img class="project-image" src="images/shogun-frontend-4.gif" alt="" />
                <figcaption>

              </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Results and Impact</h4>
              <p>After shipping the UX design updates I used Fullstory (a data analytics tool) to understand if it was easier for developers and administrators to perform core tasks like the ones we tested and discussed. I observed better time-on-task metrics and a decrease in user errors. To further validate the UX improvements, I used a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to assess user satisfaction. And when I compared the survey results to the average NPS score during the beta, I found a 3 point increase in user satisfaction!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Wrap-up</h4>
              <p>Shogun Frontend was a complex platform with a less-than-ideal user experience that arose, in part, due to its users' nuanced needs and points of view. But that's what makes a human-centered approach to research so clarifying. This research was focused on
                understanding Shogun Frontend from the perspective of developers and administrators.
                It revealed human-centered themes and patterns that the Shogun product team took into account to update and improve the platform, increasing
                satisfaction, scaling the product, and making it faster to shop online.</p>
