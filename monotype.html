              <h3>A newly released typeface licensing service has a lot of ground to cover before it can be hit with customers and users.</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>Monotype's newly released typeface licensing SaaS platform experienced low subscription renewal rates despite customer need. My research aimed to understand the root causes of this issue, focusing on the product, user experience, and overall service design, to inform improvements and increase customer retention.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>My Role and Responsibilities</h4>
              <p>As the UX Researcher, I led a mixed-methods research initiative to evaluate the SaaS platform and the surrounding customer journey. My responsibilities included: conducting heuristic analyses, moderating customer interviews, facilitating internal stakeholder workshops, synthesizing research findings, and collaborating with Product, Design, Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, and Account Management teams.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>Monotype's SaaS platform provided access to a library of licensed fonts, a crucial resource for many customers. However, the platform wasn't meeting customer expectations, leading to low renewal rates. Customers anticipated the platform would streamline their font management tasks, but many found it cumbersome and time-consuming, negatively impacting their workflows. This disconnect between expectation and reality needed to be addressed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Research Process</h4>
              <p>My research approach combined evaluative and generative methods:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Heuristic Analysis: I assessed the platform's key interfaces and user flows using both bespoke and industry-standard heuristics. This evaluation identified several usability issues related to wayfinding, accessibility, and search functionality.</li>
                <li>Customer Interviews: I conducted customer interviews to understand their experiences with the platform and the overall Monotype service. These interviews revealed a mismatch between customer expectations (set during marketing and sales) and the actual platform experience. Customers felt the platform added to, rather than simplified, their font selection process.</li>
                <li>Stakeholder Workshops: To align internal teams on the research findings and collaboratively develop solutions, I co-facilitated a two-day workshop with key stakeholders from Product, Design, Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, and Account Management.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Key Insights</h4>
              <p>The research uncovered several key insights:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Usability Issues: The heuristic analysis revealed usability problems impacting navigation, accessibility, and search.</li>
                <li>Misaligned Expectations: Customer interviews highlighted a disconnect between pre-sales expectations (of streamlined font management) and the reality of using the platform.</li>
                <li>Workflow Friction: Customers felt the platform added friction to their workflows, increasing the time required to select fonts.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>The research insights directly informed several improvements:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>SaaS Feature Roadmap Re-prioritization: The stakeholder workshop resulted in a re-prioritization of the near-term SaaS feature roadmap, focusing on addressing the identified usability issues and workflow friction.</li>
                <li>Enhanced Customer Support Services: The workshop also led to improvements in customer support services to better manage customer expectations and provide assistance with the platform.</li>
                <li>UX Updates: Based on the heuristic analysis and customer feedback, UX updates were implemented to improve wayfinding, accessibility, and search functionality, creating a more intuitive platform and enhanced user experience.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Results and Impact</h4>
              <p>The implemented UX updates and service enhancements resulted in a more intuitive platform and enhanced user experience. While specific quantifiable metrics aren't available, the project successfully aligned internal teams and led to concrete improvements in the platform and customer support services, addressing the core issues contributing to low renewal rates. The re-prioritized roadmap and enhanced support services laid the foundation for future improvements and increased customer satisfaction.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
              <p>This project demonstrated the value of combining heuristic analysis, customer interviews, and stakeholder workshops to understand and address complex UX and service design challenges. I learned the importance of aligning internal teams to create a cohesive and customer-centric experience. In future projects, I would focus on establishing clear metrics upfront to better measure the impact of UX changes on business outcomes.</p>
