              <h3>Exploring Opportunities to Enhance a New Typeface Licensing Service</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>Monotype's typeface SaaS platform, designed to address the market need for a centralized font licensing
                solution, offered a valuable solution for managing font licenses, yet customer renewals were lower than
                anticipated. My research explored the customer journey, from initial awareness to ongoing platform
                usage, to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement across the product, user experience,
                and service design.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Role and Responsibilities</h4>
              <p>As the UX Researcher, I led a mixed-methods research initiative to evaluate the SaaS platform and the
                surrounding customer journey. My responsibilities included: conducting a heuristic analysis, moderating
                customer interviews, facilitating internal stakeholder workshops, synthesizing research findings, and
                collaborating with Product, Design, Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, and Account Management teams.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>Monotype's SaaS platform provided access to a library of licensed fonts, a crucial resource for many
                customers. However, the platform wasn't meeting customer expectations, leading to low renewal rates.
                Customers anticipated the platform would streamline their font management tasks, but many found it
                cumbersome and time-consuming, negatively impacting their workflows. This disconnect between expectation
                and reality needed to be addressed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>The Research Process</h4>
              <p>My research approach combined evaluative and generative methods:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Heuristic Analysis: I assessed the platform's key interfaces and user flows using both bespoke and
                  industry-standard heuristics. This evaluation identified several usability issues related to
                  wayfinding, accessibility, and search functionality.</li>
                <li>Customer Interviews: I conducted customer interviews to understand their experiences with the
                  platform and the overall Monotype service. These interviews revealed a mismatch between customer
                  expectations (set during marketing and sales) and the actual platform experience. Customers felt the
                  platform added to, rather than simplified, their font selection process.</li>
                <li>Stakeholder Workshops: To align internal teams on the research findings and collaboratively develop
                  solutions, I co-facilitated a two-day service design workshop with key stakeholders from Product,
                  Design, Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, and Account Management.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Key Insights</h4>
              <p>The research uncovered several key insights:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Usability Issues: The heuristic analysis revealed usability problems impacting navigation,
                  accessibility, and search.</li>
                <li>Misaligned Expectations: Customer interviews highlighted a disconnect between pre-sales expectations
                  (of streamlined font management) and the reality of using the platform.</li>
                <li>Workflow Friction: Customers felt the platform added friction to their workflows, increasing the
                  time required to select fonts.</li>
                <li>Service Gaps: The customer journey mapping exercise revealed gaps in the overall service experience,
                  including inconsistent communication and limited support resources for new users.</li>
                <li>Internal Alignment: The workshop highlighted the need for better internal alignment between
                  different teams (Marketing, Sales, Product, Design, Customer Service) to ensure a consistent and
                  positive customer experience throughout the entire journey.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>The research insights directly informed several improvements:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>SaaS Feature Roadmap Re-prioritization: The stakeholder workshop resulted in a re-prioritization of
                  the near-term SaaS feature roadmap, focusing on addressing the identified usability issues and
                  workflow friction.</li>
                <li>Enhanced Customer Support Services: The workshop also led to improvements in customer support
                  services to better manage customer expectations and provide assistance with the platform.</li>
                <li>UX Updates: Based on the heuristic analysis and customer feedback, UX updates were implemented to
                  improve wayfinding, accessibility, and search functionality, creating a more intuitive platform and
                  enhanced user experience.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Results and Impact</h4>
              <p>The implemented UX updates and service enhancements resulted in a more intuitive platform and enhanced
                user experience. The project successfully aligned internal teams and led to concrete improvements in the
                platform and customer support services, addressing the core issues contributing to low renewal rates.
                The re-prioritized roadmap and enhanced support services laid the foundation for future improvements and
                increased customer satisfaction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section ">
              <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
              <p>This project demonstrated the power of integrating UX research with service design principles to
                address complex challenges. It is essential, from the beginning, to understand the entire customer
                journey, and aligning internal teams around a shared vision to create a seamless and satisfying
                experience. In future projects, I would prioritize mapping the end-to-end customer journey and
                facilitating cross-functional collaboration early in the design process to proactively identify and
                address potential service gaps.</p>
