              <p>At the time of this project, Monotype's SaaS was less than two years old and while customers needed its compliance-based service, they still where hesitant to continue their subscriptions. Wanting to understand the root cause in the drop in renewals, I approached the issue from three different angles: product, customer/user, and service.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="regular-content-section">
              <p>To start I assessed the product's key touchpoints using a set of bespoke and industry standard heuristics to pass along reccomendations to the design team. Some of which focused on improvments to wayfinding, accessibility, and search.

            <div class="regular-content-section">
              <p> To supplement my inital usability reccomendations, I conducted IDIs with Enterprise and SMB customers to understand which aspects of their buyer and user journeys were impacting their decision to renew or unsubscribe from our service. Their feedback moved us closer to understanding the cause of low renewals might be effected by misaligned expectations of precieved product and the heavy tax designers felt the platform added to their workflows.

            </div>
            <div class="regular-content-section">
              <p>I used the insights generated from interviews with customers and end-users to outline the phase most experience on their journey to and with the platform. Their journeys took them to the different domains of Monotype where they would interact with our various service sellers and providers. Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, Account Management, Product, and Design.

              <p>Wanting to tie the product assesment and customer/user insights together with internal stakeholders to align on a way forward, I co-facilitated a two-day workshop with key internal team memebers. The result of which was a re-prioritization of the near-term SaaS feature roadmap.
