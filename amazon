GREF - Project Ceres Findings Meeting

As Amazon strives to become ‘the world’s best employer,’ it must have a deep understanding of the root causes behind the current behaviors, pain points, unmet needs, and decision-making process of its employees in a hybrid work world. Additionally, GREF must also be able to meet the experience expectations, based on what influences them, for an ideal future work experience across the dynamic archetypes of its employees. GREF needs clarity and confidence in the decisions it will make to support employees as it embraces a technology-enabled, hybrid workplace experience. By engaging in a program with the third-party Artefact, GREF will gain confidence in a broad but nuanced understanding of the current and ideal employee experience in a hybrid work world as well as an actionable deliverable for improving the experience by inspiring, prioritizing, defining, and evaluating solutions already in-flight or considered for the future.
