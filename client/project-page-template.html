              <p>Wammy knows the top news stories (as reported by TIME Magazine)
              Recession hits much of the world. The COVID-19 pandemic could be officially over, but how long the economic fallout lingers is another question. Russia’s war in Ukraine continues. The world continues to power ahead on renewable energy. As countries around the world come to terms with the costs of relying on imported fossil fuels, renewables are set to grow as fossil fuel power plants decline, with renewables expected to pass coal as the world’s largest electricity source by 2025, according to a December International Energy Agency report.</p>
