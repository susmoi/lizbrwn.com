              <h3>Understanding AI Products and Their Effect on Digital Collaboration</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>The collaborative landscape is constantly evolving, and the arrival of generative AI introduces a
                powerful new force. This project explores how teams might adapt to this "force of energy," examining how
                GenAI is reshaping collaborative workflows and team dynamics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Role and Responsibilities</h4>
              <p>As a Senior Researcher at Artefact, I led the research efforts for this project to explore the impact
                of Generative AI on team collaboration. My responsibilities included designing the study, conducting
                observations and interviews, and analyzing the data, collaborating with the team to synthesize findings
                and contribute to the final report.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>The primary challenge was to understand the complex and nuanced ways in which GenAI might impact team
                collaboration. This involved exploring both the potential benefits and drawbacks of integrating AI into
                collaborative workflows. The research sought to move beyond theoretical discussions and gain real-world
                insights into how teams interact with GenAI in practice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Research Process</h4>
              <p>We adopted a qualitative research approach, combining observational sessions with in-depth interviews:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Real-World Teams: We recruited previously established teams to ensure our findings were relevant to
                  real-world collaborative scenarios.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Observational Sessions: Observing teams in action provided valuable insights into how GenAI tools were
                  integrated into existing workflows and the impact on team dynamics in real-time. We recruited four
                  teams of 3-4 individuals (designers, product managers, UX researchers, and engineers) familiar with AI
                  tools and FigJam. Teams participated in two 45-minute ideation sessions: one without AI and one with
                  AI (using tools Jambot and other GenAI tools like ChatGPT). We observed how teams interacted, communicated, and utilized
                  AI during these sessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In-depth Interviews: Following each observational session, we conducted 60-minute remote interviews
                  with 1-2 team members from each team to gather their personal experiences and perspectives on using
                  GenAI for collaboration and explore the "why" behind team behaviors and understand the subjective
                  experiences of participants.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Data Analysis: We analyzed the qualitative data from the observations and interviews to identify key
                  themes and patterns related to the impact of GenAI on team dynamics, ideation processes, and overall
                  collaboration effectiveness.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section">
              <h4>Key Insights</h4>
              <p>The research uncovered several insights into the impact of Generative AI on team collaboration:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  GenAI's Energy: GenAI can inject energy into collaborative sessions, accelerating ideation and content
                  generation. However, this speed can also lead to a loss of "meaningful slow thinking" and create
                  pressure on convergent moments. Teams may need to consciously balance speed with thoughtful
                  consideration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Divergence and Convergence: GenAI can significantly accelerate divergence by helping teams generate a
                  greater quantity of ideas. However, this abundance of ideas can make it more challenging to converge
                  on a cohesive solution. Teams may need to rethink how they structure synchronous and asynchronous time
                  to effectively manage both divergence and convergence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GenAI's Influence: Team members can perceive GenAI's contributions differently. Some may view
                  AI-generated ideas as authoritative, while others treat them as mere suggestions. Teams need to
                  establish a shared understanding of how to use AI-generated content, adopting a "fodder" mindset where
                  AI's ideas serve as a starting point for further exploration and refinement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Power Dynamics: GenAI has the potential to shift power dynamics within teams. Individuals who are
                  skilled at prompting AI or interpreting its output may exert greater influence. Teams need to
                  establish clear norms and roles for using AI to ensure equitable participation and prevent AI-related
                  dominance.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section">
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>To address the challenge of understanding the impact of GenAI on team collaboration, we adopted an
                iterative research approach, closely aligned with Figma's own product development philosophy.
                Recognizing that the integration of AI into collaborative workflows is an evolving process, we designed
                our study to not only capture current behaviors and perceptions but also to lay the groundwork for
                future research. The combination of observational sessions and in-depth interviews provided a rich
                understanding of the initial interactions between teams and GenAI, revealing key areas for exploration
                and refinement. This research serves as a foundation for an ongoing dialogue between Figma and its
                users, enabling the company to iteratively develop AI-powered collaborative tools that meet the evolving
                needs of teams in the future.</p>

            <div class="project-content-section">
              <h4>Results and Impact</h4>
              <p>The research report, detailing the multifaceted impact of GenAI on team collaboration, was shared with
                internal Figma product teams who used the insights to inform the design and development of the next
                generation of collaborative AI tools. Figma also hosted a webinar on our research findings, sparking
                discussion and interest within the design and tech communities about the future of human-AI
                collaboration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section">
              <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
              <p>This project reinforced the need for human-centered research to guide the design of AI products that
                augment human creativity and teamwork. In future research, I would explore the
                long-term impact of GenAI products on team dynamics and the evolving roles of humans and AI in collaborative
                workflows.</p>
