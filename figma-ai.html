            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>The collaborative landscape is constantly evolving, and the arrival of generative AI introduces a
                powerful new force, which has the potential to reshape and impact team collaborations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Challenge</h4>
              <p>Exploring the emerging field of collaborative-AI products by researching the real-world effect(s) GenAI has on teams and collaboration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section regular-content-section">
              <h4>The Discovery Research Process</h4>
              <p>A qualitative research approach that utilized behavioral observation sessions and in-depth interviews:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Observational Sessions: to understand how teams interacted,
                  communicated, and integrated
                  AI into their workflows, we observed teams of 3-4 designers, product managers, and engineers while they held two 45-minute ideation sessions: one with AI and one without.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In-depth Interviews: Following observational sessions, we conducted 60-minute remote interviews
                  with 1-2 team members from each team to gather their personal experiences and perspectives on using
                  GenAI for collaboration.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section">
              <h4>Key Insights</h4>
              <p>The research uncovered several insights into the impact of Generative AI on team collaboration: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  GenAI's Energy: GenAI can inject energy into collaborative sessions, accelerating ideation and content
                  generation. However, this speed can also lead to a loss of "meaningful slow thinking" and create
                  pressure on convergent moments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Divergence and Convergence: GenAI can significantly accelerate divergence by helping teams generate more ideas. However, this abundance of ideas can make converging
                  on a cohesive solution slightly more challenging.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GenAI's Influence: Team members can perceive GenAI's contributions differently. Some may view
                  AI-generated ideas as authoritative, while others treat them as mere suggestions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Power Dynamics: GenAI has the potential to shift power dynamics within teams. Individuals
                  skilled at prompting AI or interpreting its output may exert greater influence.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section">
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>A research report that served as a foundation for an ongoing dialogue between Figma and the larger GenAI product community, equipping Figma with primary knowledge of the effect of GenAI on teams.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section">
              <h4>Results and Impact</h4>
              <p>The research report, detailing the multifaceted impact of GenAI on team collaboration, was shared with
                internal Figma product teams, which used the insights to inform the next iteration of JamBot, Figma's collaborative AI tool. Additionally, Figma publicized our research findings during their 'Inside the Minds' webinar, sparking
                discussion and interest within the design and tech communities about the future of collaboration in the AI age.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-content-section">
              <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
              <p>The nascence field of co-AI has many promising opportunities for product designers, strategists, and leaders. Because many of us learned to use AI by ourselves. But in shared spaces, like the one we investigated, AI isn't just there for one person--it's there for many. So, for collaborative-AI tools to be as intuitive and user-friendly as their solo-AI counterparts, product designers and researchers will need more human(s)-centered research and design.</p>
